# Cursor / IDE Request Rules (Missy Pro Edition)

When asking the IDE/AI to edit code or docs, paste this first:

**Context**: [OS, repo root, file paths, exact lines]  
**Goal**: [one sentence outcome]  
**Constraints**: [deps, perf/SLO, security/compliance]  
**Acceptance proof**: [test to run or evidence to show]  
**Edit policy**: read 50+ lines around target, show minimal diff, stop after 3 failed loops.

Then give the task in 1-3 bullet points. Keep it surgical.
